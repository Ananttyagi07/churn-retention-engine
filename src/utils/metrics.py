Business Metrics Module

Computes essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to customer churn,
retention strategies, and customer lifetime value (LTV) for business impact analysis.

Key metrics:
- churn_rate: fraction of customers lost in a period
- retention_roi: return-on-investment estimate for retention campaigns
- lifetime_value: approximation of customer revenue over lifespan

These metrics enable data-driven business decisions and model evaluation.
